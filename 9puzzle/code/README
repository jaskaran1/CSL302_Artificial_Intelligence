This is a 9-puzzle problem solver written in C++. 
It solves the 9 Puzzle problem using different Search Techniques in AI like Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Greedy Best First Search , A* and Iterative Deepening Search and concludes that A* with Manhattan Heuristic performs the best.


Instructions for user defined input:
1)Uncomment line 117 and comment line 116 when taking input from user.The start configuration will be asked at the prompt.
2)Do vice-versa for scramble.

Instructions for C++ code:
1)Compile code using g++.
>>g++ filename.cpp
2)Redirect output to file to see the output in the file.
>>./a.out log.txt

To change values w and SOLDEPTH.
Open the .cpp file and change content of #define SOLDEPTH 10 for changing SOLDEPTH.
To change w change value of float w=0.5

Note:Don't change it to 0 as A* may go in an infinte loop for large SOLDEPTH. 

Note:While taking user input,the user input should be achievable from the goal configuration inputted.
